# A simple C++ Takeaway Ordering Program for a Level 2 Advance Programming module

+ Coded with a skeleton c++ "Takeaway.cpp" file. 
+ The program reads from a menu.csv file, and outputs a receipt once an order has been made.
+ Type "help" into the console for commands.
+ If you would like to play with the code, clone it to Visual studio, go to file > new and start the project with the existing code!
